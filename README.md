All Things rust: Self learning rust

This repo stores all basic things I will be using to learn rust syntax and any general things I think would help me in the future.

## First tutorial

The first tutorial will be followed from [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html)

We begin with the `main()` function which takes in no arguments, and is where the execution of the program begins.

To print any text we can use the `println!` macro - in the Rust programming language, macros are defined by an exclamation mark `!` at the end.
